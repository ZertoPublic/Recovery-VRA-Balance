# Recovery-VRA-Balance
This script is designed to automatically balance the recovery VRAs based on a maximum number of protected VMs per recovery VRA (Host).
This script will automatically ensure that no VRA is protecting more VMs than specified within this script, where possible.

# Getting Started
There are two versions of the script. Use RecoveryVRABalanceFor_v7+.ps1 for Zerto version 7.0 and above, or RecoveryVRABalance.ps1 for Zerto 6.5 or below.

Set the variables below including the maximum number of VMs you would like per target VRA. This should be a realistic value based on the number of VMs being protected by Zerto in your environment.

Schedule the script to run daily to keep the target VRAs balanced or run manually as required.  **MUST** be run less frequently than the resources report sample rate which **MUST** be configured to daily within site settings under reports on the target ZVM. (default is daily)
